Augmented Reality (AR):
	•	Overlays digital elements onto the real world: AR seamlessly superimposes digital objects, information, and experiences onto your physical surroundings. Imagine seeing directions overlaid on your view as you walk, or virtual furniture placed in your room to try before you buy.
	•	Requires minimal equipment: Often uses smartphones, tablets, or smart glasses to display the augmented experience.
	•	Applications: Gaming, education, tourism, navigation, maintenance, marketing, and more.
	•	Examples: Pokémon Go, IKEA Place app, Google Lens, Microsoft HoloLens.
Virtual Reality (VR):
	•	Creates a completely immersive digital environment: VR immerses you in a computer-generated world, replacing your view and perception of the real world. You can interact with objects and characters in the virtual world and feel like you're physically present.
	•	Requires specialized equipment: VR headsets block out the real world and display the virtual environment. Controllers or hand tracking enable interaction.
	•	Applications: Gaming, entertainment, education, training, design, architecture, healthcare, and more.
	•	Examples: Oculus Quest 2, PlayStation VR, HTC Vive, Google Cardboard.
Key Differences:
	•	Level of immersion: AR blends digital with the real, while VR completely replaces it.
	•	Equipment: AR often uses everyday devices, while VR requires specialized headsets.
	•	Applications: AR focuses on enhancing or informing the real world, while VR creates entirely new experiences.
The Future of AR and VR:
	•	Technology advancements: Improved hardware, software, and interaction methods will make AR and VR more realistic and accessible.
	•	Blurring the lines: Expect more hybrid experiences that combine elements of both AR and VR.
	•	Impact on various industries: These technologies will revolutionize sectors like healthcare, education, entertainment, and design.
